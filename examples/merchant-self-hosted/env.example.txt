# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================
#
# For self-hosting, you need to:
#
# 1. Generate a facilitator wallet:
#    cast wallet new
#    Save the address and private key!
#
# 2. Deploy PaymentSettlement contract (if not using shared):
#    - In Remix, deploy with YOUR facilitator address as settler
#    - Or use a shared contract (if available)
#
# 3. Fund your facilitator wallet:
#    - Send ~0.1 ETH to facilitator address on Base
#
# 4. Configure this .env:
#    - MERCHANT_ADDRESS: Your receiving wallet
#    - SETTLER_PRIVATE_KEY: Your facilitator's private key
#    - PAYMENT_SETTLEMENT_ADDRESS: Your contract address
#
# 5. Run:
#    pnpm install
#    pnpm dev
#
# This will start BOTH your facilitator and API server!
